<h3 align="center">On ios 16.x you have to enable developer mode (before you can enable it, you must sideload an app)</h3>
<h3 align="center">On A11 and A10 devices you must disable passcode, on ios 16 you must never set a passcode, if you had a passcode you have to restore with itunes</h3>
<h3 align="center">Here you can download the Palera1n loader ipa: <strong><a href="https://nightly.link/palera1n/loader/workflows/build/main/palera1n.zip">Palera1n.ipa</a></strong></h3>
<h3 align="center">How does it work: It boots the device with multiple patches required. On first run, it'll boot a ramdisk which dumps your onboard blob, creates a fakefs (if using semi tethered), installs the loader app, and patches your kernel. </h3>
